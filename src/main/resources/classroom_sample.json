As you go through it, you will receive critiques ‚Äì and not always the way you want it. You will also give critiques. This kind of self development is not easy!\n\nWhen critiquing someone, many people either:\na) just want to tell the person they're wrong, or\nb) want the person to change, but are not invested in supporting the change.\n\nMotivational Critique says: If I'm going to tell you you need to change, I'm going to be there with you to make that change. I'm invested in your success, and I care about you and your agency in that. Motivational Critique again prioritizes the connection over the correction. Conceptually, the critiquer needs to see themselves as invested in the actual improvement, not just the delivery of the critique.¬† With Motivational Critique, we'll assume there is a behavior change that needs to be made. To do it, we'll need to find a strategy that allows the person to be alert to the change and how to make the change. That strategy also needs to help them be inspired and energized to do the follow through.\n\nDescribe, in detail, a time when you offered someone a critique and also possible solutions. ¬†Follow up with that person one week later to see if they implemented your suggestions (It's ok if they did something else instead) and any outcomes that resulted.¬† Post your description in a Private Comment.\n\n‚ÄßÕô‚Å∫Àö*ÔΩ•‡ºì‚òæ‚òΩ‡ºìÔΩ•*Àö‚Å∫‚ÄßÕô\n\n3Rel.1.261 - Collaborative Problem Solving\nThe next step towards power sharing is when we can move the problem completely away from an individual and then, at the same time, equitably share in the construction of a solution or response to a challenge together. For example, instead of saying, \"How can I get you to stop being late?\" we can switch it to, \"What can we do to make it easier for you to arrive on time?‚Äù or \"How can we soften the effect of lateness on the classroom experience?\"\n\nDescribe, in detail, a time you worked collaboratively with someone to resolve a problem. Post your description in a Private Comment.\n\n‚ÄßÕô‚Å∫Àö*ÔΩ•‡ºì‚òæ‚òΩ‡ºìÔΩ•*Àö‚Å∫‚ÄßÕô\n\nAfter you are finished with both descriptions, copy and paste ALL of your private comments in¬† \"Your Response\" and Hit Turn In to complete the mission.",

Good documentation is power, especially in a bureaucracy. It's about remembering everything and predicting the future. It's about marking out the route on the map so you don't forget it. It's about tracking where you are along the way.  It's about making a checklist from the recipe, and not forgetting any of the items on your grocery list. It's about never missing an ingredient, or a step, or a tool. It's about following the directions. It's about ensuring things come out the way you want to.\n\nThis is an overview of all the Missions you'll find within the Administrative Syllabus. Please take a look at the Rubric for this Syllabus, too.\n\n2Admin.0 Guide Mission List\n2Admin.1 Structural Orientation\n2Admin.2 - Minimal Proficiency: Documentation\n2Admin.3 Sorting Your Files\n2Admin.4 Level Up\n\nOnce you have completed ALL the Missions in this Syllabus, talk to the Accountability Coordinator.

This experience is one of the most intense for most Aprendices, but it's important. We've thought about it a lot, and tried many different things, but ultimately, there are some things we do that are out of our awareness. The only way to bring them to our awareness is to make us aware of them when they're happening ‚Äì often multiple times. This doesn't always feel good ‚Äì but over and over we've seen that it's effective.\n\nYour C-WING will be with you, and they will intervene when they feel like an activity that you're doing is not expressing itself to its fullest potential and suggest alternatives. Many people find it a relief to have this kind of guidance and direction ‚Äì and many people also experience this as anxiety provoking. You are highly encouraged to talk over your lesson plan with your WING or another Profe before the session.\n\nThis program will provide you with opportunities to become a better teacher and a better person. Most of our cultural ideas about language learning and culture learning come from an academic framework ‚Äì most of us have never really seen a community-based learning environment. Here, doing it well is more important than doing it right; going with the flow is more effective than being precise; Being a good cheerleader is better than being a good explainer; it's about the people and not the content. The shame that some learners feel has to do more with their fear of looking foolish or being wrong; the shame that Aprendices feel is that learners won't respect them if they see their authority challenged. \n\nLearning a language (or any highly technical skill) is an arduous process and can feel humiliating at times. You can't take anything for granted and you regularly discover the boundaries are by accidentally bumping into them. And just to put a fine point on this, this can have legal, social, or economic consequences. As opposed to always being right, the effective classroom facilitator in an intercultural context will Model Graceful Error ‚Äì they will make it safe for all of us to be wrong, to take risks, to make mistakes. They'll accept influence and try things out that challenge them ‚Äì and yet, still acknowledge that it's their job to keep the class moving forward. Teachers don't know everything ‚Äì they know they always have more to learn. Empathize with your learners. Every day, they walk out into a confusing world where they feel wrong and out of place.\n\nThere will be a 30 minute debrief afterward. We may check in with you again within a few days to see how you're doing, and we request that you respond authentically to this.\n\nAnd by the way ‚Äì even when you get good, you'll still get embarrassed when you make a mistake. Be gentle with yourself. Life is about mistakes ‚Äì only death is error-free.\n\nAfter your Gentle Intervention, answer the following questions in the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box:\n\n‚Ä¢   When did you have your intervention? (Please write the full date.)\n‚Ä¢   What are some things you learned that you didn‚Äôt realize before?\n\n‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö\n\nAlthough this experience is not easy, it is designed to help you see things that might be out of your awareness. That never feels great, but it really makes you a better facilitator.",

How much time do they need to plan vs. how much time do you need to plan? How aware of sharing power is each person?\n\nYou are likely already aware of a social dynamic that is rarely spoken but always in play: One person tends to be the boss, and the other person tends to go along. When there are two people who want to make decisions, conflict often arises and coordination (and relationship) suffers. When there are two people who are willing to go along, decisions are left unmade, and the performance stumbles with half-starts and backtracks.\n\nMany people find these situations excruciating. We are naming this directly to surface what is normally hidden. We want you and a partner to explicitly determine who will do what. There are many ways to resolve this, but you'll need to talk about it.\n\nWe have a built in structure that can help you. It makes sense that if you've been working with a Learner and someone joins you, you'll likely be more of the decision maker. If you are joining someone else, you'll probably want to follow their lead. \n\nIt's often considered \"easier\" to not be the decision maker, as you have less responsibility. As you may have experienced when working with Shadowers, it's a lot to manage when there are many people in the session! \n\nSo, if you want to practice your going along skills, you'll have an extra hour of classroom teaching outside of your regular Sessions. Reach out to another Profe and ask if you can Tandem Teach with them. \n\nIf you want to practice your directive skills, accept someone else‚Äôs offer to join one of your Sessions. You can incorporate this Coaching Session into your regular Sessions.\n\nIf you want more corrective feedback, reach out to someone with more experience than you.\n\nCopy the following questions and answer them in the \"Your Answer\" box:\n\n‚Ä¢   Who did you Tandem Teach with?\n‚Ä¢   When did it occur? (Please write the full date.)\n‚Ä¢   Who reached out to whom?\n‚Ä¢   Describe how you worked out the roles. (We will compare your notes to your co-teacher's notes to see if your experiences were similar.)\n‚Ä¢   Who would you say \"directed\" the action? Who \"followed\"?\n‚Ä¢   What did you learn from this experience about yourself as a teacher/facilitator and how you interact with Learners?\n\n‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü: *‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü: *‚úßÔΩ•Ôæü: *‚úß\n\nHit Turn In when you're done to complete this Mission!",

                "description": "2Tech.1Minimal Proficiency: Engagement\n2Tech.1.183 - Clear Directions: Learners\n2Tech.1.277 - Clear Directions: Guests\n\nThe concept of Minimal Proficiency helps make sure that you don't fall back to less than good enough when you move on to focus on other things. These areas you will find require constant focus and attention throughout your life or career. In the music business, they call them chops. You always need to stay sharp.       \n\nThe Core Proficiency for the Technical Syllabus is Engagement. When you have a high degree of technical skill, you are able to keep your learners engaged under all circumstances. Engagement alone doesn't make you a good teacher/coach/facilitator - you can be super engaging but not necessarily be a good teacher - we call that an entertainer. \n\nA good teacher must always have control over engagement to be effective. All good teachers are entertaining (to a degree) - but not all entertainers are good teachers.\n\nIn this Mission, you'll demonstrate your Technical Proficiency by explaining how you were able to give good directions to Learners, and to Guests. \n\nŸ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂\n\n2Tech.1.183 - Clear Directions: Learners\nClarity is absolutely critical when working across language barriers. Generally, you can't explain things to language learners at the lower skill levels without risking more confusion.\n\nDescribe a moment when you gave clear directions to a Learner. Mention what you were trying to do, what happened, and what actions you took (gesture, words used, etc.) to make it happen.\n\nSubmit your answer in a private comment.\n\nŸ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂\n\n2Tech.1.277 - Clear Directions: Guests\nIt may come as a surprise, but giving clear directions to a Shadower or other Guest can be even harder than with a Learner! This is because it sounds a little bossy to tell someone else what to do. But when you're facilitating something as nuanced as language practice, you need to feel comfortable giving clear directions to anyone who comes to your session. When you don't, one of two things happens - they take over your session and take it in a different direction, or they sit quietly in the back. If this is happening, you have not reached minimal proficiency yet.\n\nDescribe a moment when you gave clear directions to a Shadower, Assistant, or Guest. Mention what you were trying to do, what happened, and what actions you took (gesture, words used, etc.) to make it happen. Specifically mention how you told them (politely, but clearly) what they should do, and that they did what you asked them to.\n\nTell us what happened in a private comment.         \n\nŸ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂Ÿ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂Ÿ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂                                                              \n\nWhen you‚Äôve completed all Tasks in this Mission, copy and paste ALL of your private comments into the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box.

This doesn't have to be someone famous or super notable ‚Äì if you are doing In The Kitchen, and you have a friend who loves to make mashed potatoes, you can bring them in as a guest speaker. Ideally, you will invite an expert in some area to participate as the subject of language practice.¬† May be repeated unlimited times.\n\nDocument this challenge in your session report and paste your Session Report in your answer box below to complete this challenge.\n\nBringing the Actual Pie\nUse a recipe and make a dish with a learner in a Session.¬† Coordinate with your learner ahead of time, so you are making your food together as a language learning experience.¬†\n\nDocument the experience in your Session Report and paste your Session Report in your answer box below to complete this challenge.\n\nTruth to Power\nTell someone who has more power or privilege than you in some way, or who intimidates you, something that is difficult for you to say, or for them to hear.

Your goal is not to explain or contradict the person, but to accept their Truth. Though we are generally talking about someone who you are coaching, or someone with less experience, this might occur elsewhere in your life. Talk to the Apprentices Coordinator, or anyone with more experience or power than you about your feelings and the critique, and admit that you were wrong, or make it up to the person if that's appropriate. May be performed unlimited times for credit.\n\nPlease tell us about your experience, including the date and the name of the person you spoke to, in your answer box below.\n\nThat Was Hard For Me\nAfter having an experience that was very difficult, talk about it with any other person in the Guild, about why it was hard, what you might have done differently, and what you'd do differently in the future.

These areas you will find require constant focus and attention throughout your life or career. In the music business, they call them chops. You always need to stay sharp.                                                                                                       \n\nDescribe in detail an event, situation, or behavior that you experienced in one of the sessions. Describe how you inquired about it and received a response that enabled you to see the event differently, with this in turn causing you to change your future behavior. \n\nFor example: I saw the Profe require all participants to start by saying \"Hi\" and then their name - and when people didn't say it, they sort of made them do it. I thought it was kind of intense, and saying Hi isn't very hard, so it didn't seem like it was helping their English very much. But instead of saying \"You don't need to make them say each other's names so robotically\" - I asked instead, \"I saw you were very consistent in asking each person to say hello before asking the question.\" I learned that the pattern helps calm people so they can prepare to focus on the content, and it helps make certain communication patterns that are common in the US become more 2nd nature. Plus, it's more fun! So now, I do it too!\"\n\n(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)\n\nPost your reflection in \"Your Response\" and hit Turn In to complete the Mission.",

                "description": "The Relational Syllabus is the learning dimension that develops your capacity to connect. This is critical for Intercultural Communication for a couple of reasons. First, all communication implies connection. But even more importantly, when you're working across language barriers, we often think that we can't communicate because we can't connect. But there are other ways of connecting without using words ‚Äì and that connection enables communication. You have to know some things about humans and how they learn, you have to practice, but you can get quite good at it. It's also about how we learn to develop skills ‚Äì ongoing connection is is the mechanism of language and culture learning.  And it's also how people heal. A separation is a wound, and connection is a healing. \n\nPeople change when they meet other people.\n\nIt's about your personal connection to what's on the map, the reasons why you want to use the map to get somewhere, about who is there, or what you are wanting to do when you arrive.  It might even be about asking someone to help you interpret or use a map, or even throwing the map away and asking for directions. It's about who you are making the recipe for, and who gave it to you, and what making that recipe means in a line of other people who've made that recipe.\n\nThis is an overview of all the Missions you'll find within the Relational Syllabus.

We must make sure that each Learner can use Zoom and What's App. This is especially true for those who have limited tech skills, limited formal education, and/or limited English. If the learner has low skills in all three areas, they will need considerable support navigating digital tools. \n\nWe also can take the time to get to know the person a little bit, to learn what their goals and dreams are, and prepare to adjust for other barriers they may have. Or, identify if perhaps what we have to offer is not what they're looking for. \n\nTo complete this Task, you will Shadow a Tech Check.¬†\nDays¬† and times will be posted in the Aprendiz Corner in WhatsApp. Just¬† comment on the session you'd like to join, and we will get you scheduled.\n\n Most of the time, they are about 30 minutes, and pretty straightforward. Sometimes, it takes longer if they really struggle. \n\nWhat day did you attend a Tech Check? Post the date and the name of the person who was performing the Tech Check (not the Learner) in a private comment.\n\n( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )\n\n1Tech.6.121 - Proficiency Action Plan Intake\nAs you've worked through these Missions and Tasks, you've been exposed to the tools, techniques, and philosophies that drive our practice. The Proficiency Plan Intake gives you a chance to see how all of these things work together ‚Äì and where you fit in, too ‚Äì in someone's long-term learning trajectory.\n\nOpen the \"Footbridge/Pasarela-Proficiency Action Plan Intake Form\" and fill it out for a language you'd like to learn, so you can get a feel for what it's like to think seriously about how you'd put the time aside to learn a language. \n\nWhat language did you choose? What about the Proficiency Plan Intake did you find interesting? What part did you find surprising or confusing? Post your reaction into a private comment. \n\n( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )\n\n1Tech.6.122 - Teachnology & Teachnique\nHopefully, you've been using the Teachnology & Teachnique Symbaloo (linked below) to mine our treasure trove of teaching resources! Choose a resource and use it in a Session.\n\nType into a private comment which resource you used and the date you did it.\n\n( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )\n\nWhen you're done with all three above, copy your answers from the private comments into the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box.

Review these techniques by using the link below. These are the \"atoms\" of your your sessions ‚Äì mostly the Input & Output. When you combine these atoms, you get Activities, which are sort of like the molecules of your session. (You've already learned about one Activity: Transcription. It's the most profound, versatile activity, and it's extra special because when combined with video or audio with a transcript, it becomes a very powerful self-practice activity.)\n\nCombine activities in a number of ways, and you have a sort of learning compound, which we'll call a Session (or a Lesson, if it's a group). \n\nThat's about as far as THAT metaphor will take us...  So check out the Secret Activity Menu below to see some ways you can put together Essential Techniques to make simple, effective Activities.\n\nNotice how we don't talk about level. That's because Activities usually don't have a level, although the \"canonical,\" or baseline, version of the Activity will usually be most suitable for a particular level or levels. We want you to think about how the \"canonical\" activity can be used for different levels and how to modify it for different content.\n\nWhat tech do you need to do the Box of 10?\n\nLet us know in a private comment.\n\n‚ãá‚ãÜ‚ú¶‚ãÜ‚ãá\n\n1Tech.5.116 - 3 Masts\nWe use a lot of metaphors in this program. Some people find it annoying.  We're sorry. But here's the reason why - metaphors can help bring a concept to life when you've got big ideas going on - and what we call \"extended metaphors\" - the metaphor is actually illuminating the structure of something in a way that we can continue to apply other elements of the metaphor to deepen our understanding. We're also just kind of word nerds too. As English teachers (language and cultural skills development practitioners) we build boats, drive cars, bake pies, operate restaurants, dance dances, combine molecules, cross bridges (and, like, most of us can't do most of these things, haha). But, if we wanted to learn, the process that you'd go through would be similar to this program. \n\nAs you've noticed, this part of the program we focus a lot on nautical metaphors. So, here, we have 3 \"Masts\"or the main pillars of your \"boat\". Any sailboat has to have a mast to hold the sails. When you have multiple masts, you can use different size and configuration of sails to make big boats sail fast, and turn in different ways. Different configurations have different properties. You can get by with one Mast, but with 3, you can do a lot more. \n\nLook at the document below and click on the links within to explore the resources.\n\nWhich Mast is most intriguing to you? Why?\n\nSubmit your answer in a private comment.\n\n‚ãá‚ãÜ‚ú¶‚ãÜ‚ãá\n\n1Tech.5.118 - 5 Session Sprint\nYour teacher training tasks are broken down into 5 sessions with a Learner. We know that you know this isn't enough to make a major impact on their learning trajectory. However, it's enough to learn something, isn't it?\n\nThe 5 Session Sprint approach:\n‚Äì Helps Profes think in terms of very clear outcomes\n‚Äì Makes progress objectives more tangible for everyone involved\n‚Äì Allows the Learner to control their trajectory more\n\nRead the 5 Session Sprint document below.\n\nHow many hours does it take for a Learner to start noticing a change in their skills?\n\nWrite your answer in a private comment.\n\n‚ãá‚ãÜ‚ú¶‚ãÜ‚ãá\n\n1Tech.5.119 - Transcription\nThis should seem familiar - we present it in a variety of locations through Stage0 and Stage1. That's because it‚Äôs such an incredibly powerful technique that you can almost teach any person or group effectively and dynamically with variations on this one technique. \n\n(Walk A Minute in my Shoes - Stage0 - 0Cre.1.02) \n(Listen and Type - Stage0 - 0Tech.1.039) \n(Secret Activity Menu above - 1Tech.5.115) \n\nLanguage learners often don‚Äôt get enough listening practice. Transcription is a straightforward activity, flexible and easy to implement and modify with very little preparation. Learners can also do on their own for practice, outside of 1:1 sessions. It‚Äôs easy to document and track progress when you have many learners. It's also incredibly versatile. If presented well, almost any listening content can be a short, ready-made skill builder or a month-long project, regardless of level.\n\nUse the Transcription activity in a Session with one of your Learners. Discuss your experience with it in a private comment.¬† \n\n‚ãá‚ãÜ‚ú¶‚ãÜ‚ãá‚ãÜ‚ú¶‚ãÜ‚ãá‚ãÜ‚ú¶‚ãÜ‚ãá\n\nWhen you‚Äôve completed all tasks in this mission, copy and paste ALL of your private comments into the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box.

You can bring up to three Session Reports if you want to take care of this all at once.

Because we're not grading you on understanding but are creating an opportunity for you to develop your coaching skills, we use the concept of minimal proficiency to ensure that you're able to do the basics that an experienced language & cultural skills coach would be expected to do.\n\nThe Core Proficiency for the Technical Syllabus is Engagement. When you have a high degree of technical skill, you are able to keep your learners engaged under all circumstances. \n\nA good teacher must always have control over engagement to be effective. When you work 1:1, you need to be able to roll with whatever happens. It's important to plan, but if your plan is not what the person wants, they will disengage. If you decide they need that thing, but aren't wanting it, you have to figure out ways to get them there. It's not enough to say \"they just weren't engaged\" - you have to figure out how to engagement them. We sometimes say, \"Planning is Everything, but the Plan is Nothing.\"\n\nOn the other hand - the way to find out what the Learner wants is usually not to ask them directly. It doesn't make sense in a lot of cultures, but also usually this level of following the learner is giving up your role of leading. Start somewhere, and then adjust as you go. Trim the Sails. \n\nIn this Mission, you'll demonstrate your Technical Proficiency by explaining how you were able to roll with it when something did not go as planned. \n\n ï¬∑Õ°·¥•¬∑ î\n\n1Tech.1.108 - Roll With It\nOne of the major differences between group facilitation and 1:1 coaching is how you plan. Planning is much more important when working with groups than when working one-on-one. With 1:1 coaching, you need to be present with your Learner, sometimes leading, and sometimes following. That doesn't mean asking the Learner what they want to learn each time; It means preparing something that you think might be useful, observing how the Learner responds, and using that as an opportunity to get to know them better.\n\n ï¬∑Õ°·¥•¬∑ î ï¬∑Õ°·¥•¬∑ î ï¬∑Õ°·¥•¬∑ î\n\nIn the form below, let us know how you think you're doing.

If there's a different Challenge you really want to do, the Coordinator of Apprentices must approve it.¬†¬†\n\nLife Preserver - Ask for help. The situation must prevent you from making a serious mistake.¬† You must make the request directly of the person who would provide the help for the problem that would be solved.\n\nWrite a brief reflection of the experience, including the date and the name of the person who helped you, and post in your answer box below to get credit for the challenge.\n\nGuest Speaker - Facilitate a session with a guest speaker in some area that connects with your theme. This doesn't have to be someone famous or super notable ‚Äì if you are doing In The Kitchen, and you have a friend who loves to make mashed potatoes, you can bring them in as a guest speaker. Ideally, you will invite an expert in some area to participate as the subject of language practice. ¬†May be repeated unlimited times.\n\nDocument the challenge in your session report.¬† Copy and Paste your session report into your answer box below to complete the challenge.\n\nBringing the Actual Pie - To confront this challenge, use a recipe and make a dish with a learner in a session. Coordinate with your learner ahead of time, so you are making your food together as a language learning experience.¬†¬†The food itself must contribute in a meaningful way to the lesson and classroom connection.¬†\n\nDocument the session in your session report and copy and paste session report into your answer box below to get credit for the challenge.\n\nTruth to Power - Tell someone who has more power or privilege than you in some way, or who intimidates you, something that is difficult for you to say, or for them to hear. The Truth must be true, but it need not be ‚Äúright‚Äù (for example, \"I feel like you don't trust me\", could be true without being right). Your goal is to have that person hear your truth. Though we are generally talking about someone who is coaching you, or someone with more experience than you, this might occur elsewhere in your life. May only be performed once for credit, though you are encouraged to speak truth to power regularly and often.\n\nPlease tell us about the experience in your answer box to get credit for the challenge.\n\nI Was Wrong - Listen to someone who has less power or privilege than you in some way, tell you a Truth that might be difficult for them to say or for you to hear. The Truth must be true, but it need not be ‚Äúright‚Äù (for example, \"I feel like you don't trust me\", could be true without being right). Your goal is not to explain or contradict the person, but to accept their Truth. Though we are generally talking about someone who you are coaching, or someone with less experience, this might occur elsewhere in your life. Talk to the Apprentices Coordinator, or anyone with more experience or power than you about your feelings and the critique, and admit that you were wrong, or make it up to the person if that's appropriate. May be performed unlimited times for credit.\n\nPlease tell us about the experience in your answer box to get credit for the challenge.\n\nThat Was Hard For Me - After having an experience that was very difficult, talk about it with any other person in the Guild, about why it was hard, what you might\nhave done differently, and what you'd do differently in the future.¬† May be performed once for credit, but unlimited times for connection and growth.\n\nPlease tell us about the experience in your answer box to get credit for the challenge.\n\nI'll Scratch Your Back - Assist with someone else's session. Confirm with the Profe 48 hours before the session and reflect and discuss with the Profe following the session.¬†\n\nPlease tell us about the experience in your answer box to get credit for the challenge.\n\n( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )( ‚ùõ·¥ó‚ùõ )\n\nIn the \"Your Answer\" box, please tell us which Elective Challenge you completed and when you completed it.",

Our mission is to provide intercultural communication services to the emerging America that embraces its multiethnic, multilingual identity.\n\nImmigrants from Europe came to this land and colonized it, committing genocide. They kidnapped people from Africa and used them to build an economy. There is a huge irony to the idea that to be \"American\" means to look white and fear new refugees. The Statue of Liberty reminds us that America is a nation that welcomes immigrants.\n\nWe believe that, for America to truly be the land of the free, we must shift and transform to accept newcomers as one necessary part of the process of redeeming our history of inequality. It is not the only part.\n\nIt's not just about how well we teach someone English ‚Äì it's about how much we grow every time we welcome a newcomer, learn about a new culture, help someone get their citizenship, and especially, open a door that was closed before.\n\nWe Are America's Welcome Wagon.\n\n0Eth.1.022 - P-P-T Values\nClick Bringing the Pie to go to a document that describes our overall ethic of \"Bringing the Pie\".\n\nWhat is the opposite of \"Bringing the Pie\"?\n\nLet us know in a private comment.\n\n‚úº„ÄÄ “â „ÄÄ‚úº\n\n0Eth.1.023 - 7 Virtues of the Interculturalist\nCheck out the document below to read about the 7 Virtues of the Interculturalist.\n\nWhich one comes most naturally to you?\n\nSubmit your answer in a private comment.\n\n‚úº„ÄÄ “â „ÄÄ‚úº„ÄÄ\n\n0Eth.1.024 - Interculturalist Creed\nWe believe that teaching English, especially working with immigrants and refugees, can be a tool for  people to \"have a better life.\"\n\nWithin the idea of a \"better life,\" so much is unspoken. We wanted to link our desire to be helpful and provide services to a practice of dismantling racism and colonialism ‚Äì of using privilege for good. This can be uncomfortable, but the aim is to not only be helpful, but to increase our neighbors' Social Power and capacity to live their lives the way they want.\n\nRead our current articulation of Social Power and our beliefs about the responsibility of those with certain power to neutralize their advantage or spread the goods around more equitably. You do not have to agree with everything in this document. However, if you see English as a tool that became powerful through historical forces, imperialism, and colonization, you'll probably feel like you're in the right place. If you feel that English is the best language and everyone should speak it because it's better than other languages, or that people who don't speak English well shouldn't really be in an English speaking country, you will probably feel like this is not the place for you.\n\nSkim the Interculturalist Creed. React in some way in a private comment.\n\n‚úº„ÄÄ “â „ÄÄ‚úº„ÄÄ\n\n0Eth.1.025 - Schoolhouse Rules\nAlthough P-P-T is not a traditional school, we still have policies, guidelines, and cultural norms that we expect our staff, apprentices, visitors, and learners to respect. \n\nTake a look at our Schoolhouse Rules.\n\nIt's a lot to go through right now, but just from looking at the titles of each of the sections, which do you think you're going to need most right now?\n\nTell us in a private comment.\n\n‚úº„ÄÄ “â „ÄÄ ‚úº„ÄÄ “â „ÄÄ ‚úº„ÄÄ “â „ÄÄ‚úº\n\nWhen you‚Äôve completed all tasks in this mission, copy and paste ALL of your private comments into the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box.

None of them can present the whole truth of who we are. You never know how you look through other people's eyes. And we change too. To do effective intercultural work, it's absolutely critical that  we be able to reflect on ourselves and how other people see us. The problem is that there's no foolproof way to do that. \n\nThe fields of psychology and spirituality are overburdened with many types of personality assessments. There are so many, and of varying quality - and the advent of the internet brought us a tsunami of clickbait pop psychology. Tarot cards and Astrology get a little more woo-woo. Opinions about all personality typing are strong, from disgust to reverence. This Mission invites you to explore these funhouse mirrors of self-reflection not as manuals of truth but fuzzy guideposts. The process of thinking about and reflecting on your answers may be more important than the actual results. \n\nA useful approach is to believe the results are not fixed, but can provide insight. If you think the results are false, for instance, you can ask yourself why you believe they are false and reflect on where you're getting your information about who you are. We hope that those who give magical reverence to personality typing can ease up a little, and those who feel that they are evil or complete bunk can recognize that this kind of insight is part of human experience across cultures.\n\nWe've chosen a free, relatively short personality assessment based on one of the more useful frameworks: the Big Five. Like all typing schemes, it's flawed in many ways. But the Big Five is the only personality typing model that has even tried to establish some scientific viability cross culturally. \n\nFollow the link to the Free Big Five Personality Test from Truity.com and write your scores in the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box. ¬†Please note, the full analysis requires that you pay $20. We do not recommend that you pay this, and it is not required to purchase anything to complete any Mission, though of course you can if you want. Completing the assessment and gathering your numerical scores is all we're asking. Besides, the process is probably more useful than the outcome anyway.\n\nŸ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂Ÿ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂Ÿ©(‚óï‚Äø‚óï)€∂\n\nWrite your scores in the \"Your Answer\" box and hit Turn In to complete this Mission!\n\nTo learn more about personality assessment and see some other assessment tools related to successful intercultural navigation, check out the additional attached documents on the Intercultural Effectiveness Scale and Administering IPIP Measures.",

These techniques are simple, but we can do a lot with very little.\n\nYou can combine these techniques with each other and a variety of materials to create more complex practice routines which we call \"Activities\". The Essential Techniques are like atoms, and when we combine them, they become like molecules of language learning. We won‚Äôt explain too much more here, but keep these techniques in mind as you gather your Shadowing Experiences. If you want to know more, just ask someone!\n\nAfter you've gotten an overview of the techniques we use as the foundation for solid, engaging classes, we‚Äôd like you to explore our Teachnology & Teachnique classroom. Join using the link below, and find a resource that you‚Äôre interested in using in your classes. Then tell us:\n\nWhich essential technique (or techniques!) do you think you would use with that resource?\n\nPlease submit your ideas in a private comment.\n\n‡∏Ö·ë¶( ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ )·ê£‡∏Ö\n\n0Tech.1.041 - CEFR Levels\nThere are a lot of different ways to evaluate people‚Äôs levels. We use the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, or CEFR. It‚Äôs kind of like a rubric.\n\nHere are the basics:\n‚Äì Level A Learners cannot have a conversation in English.\n‚Äì Level B Learners can have a conversation in English. You can ask them questions, and they are able to elaborate to varying degrees depending on the familiarity of the subject.\n‚Äì Level C Learners can speak English very well. They are considered fluent and can speak English proficiently in professional settings.\n\n1 is on the lower side, and 2 is on the higher side. So, an A1 Learner would be a true beginner, and C2 Learner would be able to speak English \"as mother tongue.\"\n\nThat‚Äôs all you need to know for now, but take a look at the global scale table from the Council of Europe (attached) if you want to dig in deeper.\n\nHave you assessed Learner levels before? How comfortable are you with the process?\n\nSubmit your answer in a private comment.\n\n‡∏Ö·ë¶( ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ )·ê£‡∏Ö\n\n0Tech.1.047 - Emergent Curriculum\nWhat are we learning English about?\n\nMany language skills programs take an academic approach to curricula: learning a language is about knowing facts, such as grammar and vocabulary. This isn't a bad thing, but we emphasize that learning about a language is not the same as learning how to speak it.\n\n(This goes for teaching, too!)\n\nIn one-on-one learning settings, our goal is not so much to \"teach English\" as it is to support people meeting their goals, incorporating their language skills as a focal point. The Emergent Curriculum is an approach to working with an individual person where we continually discover what their practice materials are. Listen to the Learner, follow the clues they give you, and you end up discovering the next thing you‚Äôll study together.\n\nYou develop a relationship with a Learner and build their curriculum like a story. You Make the Road by Walking.\n\nUse the Essential Techniques to start somewhere, focusing on Real World Curriculum elements that are safe and common to everyone (family, food, weather). Make note of things that happen so you can figure out where to go next. Then use the documentation tools to keep track of what you find. As you look back, you'll see the path you took. That's what we call the Emergent Curriculum.\n\nHow do you feel about this approach to curriculum? Does it seem doable to you? What doubts do you have about this approach to curriculum development?\n\nShare your thoughts in a private comment.\n\n‡∏Ö·ë¶( ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ )·ê£‡∏Ö‡∏Ö·ë¶( ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ )·ê£‡∏Ö‡∏Ö·ë¶( ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ )·ê£‡∏Ö\n\nWhen you‚Äôve completed all tasks in this mission, copy and paste ALL of your private comments into the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box.

After you've read through the presentations, please answer the following questions:\n\nüí¨Connective Communication\nWhen should you send a reminder to your learners about an upcoming Session?\n\nSubmit your answer as a private comment.\n\nüî¨Appreciative Inquiry\nHow should you fram corrective feedback?\n\nSubmit your answer as a private comment.\n\nüéØMotivational Critique\nWhat is unambiguous way to let your learner know that they hit the bullseye ?\n\nSubmit your answer as a private comment.\n\nü§ùüèæCollaborative Problem Solving\nWhat are you committing to when you identify an area for improvement?\n\nSubmit your answer as a private comment.\n\n*Ôºä‚úø‚ùÄ‚úøÔºä* Ôºä‚úø‚ùÄ‚úøÔºä**Ôºä‚úø‚ùÄ‚úøÔºä*\n\nWhen you‚Äôve completed all tasks in this mission, copy and paste ALL of your private comments into the ‚ÄúYour Answer‚Äù box.

You've made it into the Google Classroom for the English for the Community Apprenticeship (Quest of the Proficiency Coach)! \n\nGoogle Classroom is great because it's free and accessible. But it's also a bit clunky. We find the biggest challenge is that people get confused about what to do next. At the same time, we wanted to make a program where you could make some choices on your own and go at your own pace. \n\nThis is hard to do - the more we make it linear, the more it becomes robotic. The more flexibility you have, the harder it is to figure out. This is a difficult problem to solve, and we are doing our best with our limited resources. Still, hundreds of people have developed their skills with us, and you will too if you stick with it!\n\nIt's a little like learning a new language. You kind of have to become used to the ambiguity, talk to a lot of people, and never give up.\n\n(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü*(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü*(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü*(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü*(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü*(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü*(‚ùÅ¬¥‚Äø`‚ùÅ)*‚ú≤Ôæü\n\nüåç Take a look at the Coggle diagram as a visual checklist to guide you.
